# skytreader's self-story

Hi I'm Chad.

I have experience in a multitude of industries and positions. From improving
legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a
fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users. In my free time, I love writing Code
That Is Poetry but day-to-day I am not an idealist engineer who doesn't
compromise. Well-engineered code is clean and correct but correct above all
else.

Oh, also, I'm great at writing documentation. I consider myself introverted but
apparently my communication skills are above average for Software Engineers. I
also pride myself on my humility and modesty. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

If you are looking for the no-holds-barred, more-boring version of my Personal
